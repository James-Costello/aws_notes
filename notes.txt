IAM
-centralized control of AWS account
-Shared Access to your AWS account
-Granular Permissions
-Identity Federation (so dumb)...faceberg, chainedin
-multifacotr authentication
-provide temp access for developers
-set up passwords

IAM - critical terms

-users - end users (ppl)
-groups - a collection of users
-roles - you create roles and assign to EC2 instance, that EC2 instance can interact with S3
-policies - permissions

S3 -101
-Simple Storage Service
-a place to store files in the cloud
-object base vs block base
- object storage = flat files, videos, word docs, images, etc NOT OS
- spread across multiple facilities and devices

Basics
-FIles can be from 0 bytes to 5TB
-unlimited storage
-files are stored in buckets (folders)
-S3 is a universal name space, need a unique name
- s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/namefors#
- when uploading a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code

Data consistency model for S3
-read after write is instantaneous
editing or deleting takes time to propigate and be consistent across facilities

S3 is a simple key, value store
-object based storage: key (name) = value (data as sequence of bytes)
-Version ID & metadata

EC2

EC2 is instance storage vs EBS which is block storage
EBS allows for OS, etc

EBS Volume Types:
SSD, non sequential data, NOSQL...up to 20,000 IOPS
HDD, magnetic and sequential, data warehouses, big data
Magnetic (Standard, cheapest) cold hard disk drive

Security Group Notes:
-All Inbound Traffic is Blocked by Default
-All Outbound Trafic is allowed
-Changes to security groups take effect immediately
-You can have any number of EC2 instances within a group
-Security groups are STATEFUL
If you want to block specific IP addresses usr Network Access Control Lists

Exam Tips
-EBS Volumes can be changed on the fly (except for magnetic std)
-Best practice to EC2 instance adn then change volume
-You can change volume types by taking a snapshot and tehn using the snapshot to create a new volume
-change a volume on the fly requires 6/hr wait
-you can scale EBS volumnes up only
-Volumes must be in the same AZ (availability zones) as the EC2 instances
