EC2 is instance storage vs EBS which is block storage
EBS allows for OS, etc

EBS Volume Types:
SSD, non sequential data, NOSQL...up to 20,000 IOPS
HDD, magnetic and sequential, data warehouses, big data
Magnetic (Standard, cheapest) cold hard disk drive

Security Group Notes:
-All Inbound Traffic is Blocked by Default
-All Outbound Trafic is allowed
-Changes to security groups take effect immediately
-You can have any number of EC2 instances within a group
-Security groups are STATEFUL
If you want to block specific IP addresses usr Network Access Control Lists

Exam Tips
-EBS Volumes can be changed on the fly (except for magnetic std)
-Best practice to EC2 instance adn then change volume
-You can change volume types by taking a snapshot and tehn using the snapshot to create a new volume
-change a volume on the fly requires 6/hr wait
-you can scale EBS volumnes up only
-Volumes must be in the same AZ as the EC2 instances
